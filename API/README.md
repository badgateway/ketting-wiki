Ketting - A hypermedia client for javascript
============================================

Introduction
------------

The Ketting library is an attempt at creating a 'generic' hypermedia client, it
supports an opinionated set of modern features REST services might have.

The library supports [HAL][hal], [JSON:API][jsonapi], [Siren][siren],
[Collection+JSON][coljson], [Web Linking (HTTP Link Header)][1] and HTML5
links. It uses the Fetch API and works both in the browsers and in node.js.

### Example

```js
const ketting = new Ketting('https://api.example.org/');

// Follow a link with rel="author". This could be a HTML5 `<link>`, a
// HAL `_links` or a HTTP `Link:`.
const author = await ketting.follow('author');

// Grab the current state
const authorState = await author.get();

// Change the firstName property of the object. Note that this assumes JSON.
authorState.firstName = 'Evert';

// Save the new state
await author.put(authorState);
```

Notable Features
----------------

Ketting is a library that sits on top of a [Fetch API][3] to provide a RESTful
interface and make it easier to follow REST best practices more strictly.

It provides some useful abstractions that make it easier to work with true
hypermedia / HATEOAS servers. It currently parses [HAL][hal] and has a deep
understanding of links and embedded resources. There's also support for parsing
and following links from HTML documents, and it understands the HTTP `Link:`
header.

Using this library it becomes very easy to follow links from a single bookmark,
and discover resources and features on the server.

Supported formats:

* [HAL][hal]
* [Siren][siren]
* HTML - Can automatically follow `<link>` and `<a>` element with `rel=`
  attributes.
* [HTTP Link header][1] - automatically registers as links regardless of format.
* [JSON:API][jsonapi] - Understands the `links` object and registers collection
  members as `item` relationships.
* [application/problem+json][problem] - Will extract useful information from
  the standard problem object and embed them in exception objects.

Other features:

* [Prefer-Push][prefer-push]
* [Prefer-Transclude][prefer-transclude]

### Following links

One core tenet of building a good REST service, is that URIs should be
discovered, not hardcoded in an application. It's for this reason that the
emphasis in this library is _not_ on URIs (like most libraries) but on
relation-types (the `rel`) and links.

Generally when interacting with a REST service, you'll want to only hardcode
a single URI (a bookmark) and discover all the other APIs from there on.

For example, consider that there is a some API at `https://api.example.org/`.
This API has a link to an API for news articles (`rel="articleCollection"`),
which has a link for creating a new article (`rel="new"`). When `POST`ing on
that URI, the API returns `201 Created` along with a `Location` header pointing
to the new article. On this location, a new `rel="author"` appears
automatically, pointing to the person that created the article.

This is how that interaction might look like:

```js
const ketting = new Ketting('https://api.example.org/');
const createArticle = await ketting.follow('articleCollection').follow('new'); // chained follow

const newArticle = await createArticle.post({ title: 'Hello world' });
const author = await newArticle.follow('author');

// Output author information
console.log(await author.get());
```

More details can be found in the [Getting started docs][8] and
[Following Links][10].

### Embedded resources

Embedded resources are a HAL feature. In situations when you are modeling a
'collection' of resources, in HAL you should generally just create links to
all the items in the collection. However, if a client wants to fetch all these
items, this can result in a lot of HTTP requests. HAL uses `_embedded` to work
around this. Using `_embedded` a user can effectively tell the HAL client about
the links in the collection and immediately send along the contents of those
resources, thus avoiding the overhead.

Ketting understands `_embedded` and completely abstracts them away. If you use
Ketting with a HAL server, you can therefore completely ignore them.

For example, given a collection resource with many resources that have the
relationship type `item`, you might use the following API:

```js
const ketting = new Ketting('https://api.example.org/');
const articleCollection = await ketting.follow('articleCollection');

const items = await someCollection.followAll('item');

for (const item of items) {
   console.log(await item.get());
}
```

Given the last example, if the server did _not_ use embedding, it will result
in a HTTP GET request for every item in the collection.

If the server _did_ use embedding, there will only be 1 GET request.

A major advantage of this, is that it allows a server to be upgradable. Hot
paths might be optimized using embedding, and the client seamlessly adjusts
to the new information.

Automatically parsing problem+json
----------------------------------

If your server emits application/problem+json documents ([RFC7807][problem])
on HTTP errors, the library will automatically extract the information from
that object, and also provide a better exception message (if the title
property is provided).
